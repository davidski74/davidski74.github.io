        <h1>Welcome to David G's <em>W a c k y</em> Webpage! Make yourself at home!</h1>
        <p> Hello, my name is David Gadomski, the creator of this web page, here you will find information about me, my javascript programs and other info you may or may not find intriguing. As of now, I have not created any Javascript programs, so there will be more to come on that side of my web page. And on the About Me page, you will find information about this web page's creator(which would be me, David Gadomski), although I can ensure you that it is not all that interesting. So please, kick your shoes off, kick up your feet and make yourself at home, at my <em>wacky</em> web page!
